### Quick Vid API

This is a basic youtube clone but for uploading quick videos through screen recording which can then be watched, comment and also share the recorded video. This was xcreated using the LoomSDK

You can view the [quick-vid-client](https://github.com/Benrobo/quick-vid)

## Inspiration

We all know how stressful it is to look for quick tutorials out there, sometimes when we go online to search an article from a blog posts, we dont get exactly what we want and sometimes we we also dont remember what we read in that blog posts. That when quick-vid was born, quick vid is a clone of youtube which allow users to register, get logged in and upload a quick video tutorials by recording their pc and then save within the site which an be shared latter to who ever you like or to either slack workspace and discord server.

## What it does

It allows users to record their screen for a quick video tutorial or any other educational activities and automatically be shared on the platform.

## How we built it

This was built on top of the LoomSDK along with React.js and Node.js, Express.js and Postgresql for the backend

## Challenges we ran into

Some of the challenges i passed through was not able to add more functionality for screen recording and other complex features as i was limited to what the loomSDK provided.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I was proud to get this app up and running as quickly as possible

## What we learned

Am really great full of having this experience with the possibilities and doors open when it comes video messaging which LoomSDK provided for we developers.

## What's next for quick-vid

Well as this is just the MVP of this application, i planned to expand more on this in later future to come.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
